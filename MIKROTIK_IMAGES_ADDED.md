# MikroTik Manager Project Added to Portfolio

The MikroTik Manager project has been successfully added to your portfolio with multiple images in a carousel.

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Multiple Images Support**:
   - Updated the project data structure to include an optional `images` array
   - Modified the `ProjectsSection.tsx` component to display a carousel when multiple images are available
   - Added both `mikrotik-manager-main.jpg` and `mikrotik-manager-login.jpg` to the project display

2. **Created Type Definitions**:
   - Added a `Project` interface in `data.ts` to properly type the project data
   - Updated all component props to use the new interface

3. **Enhanced Mobile Display**:
   - The carousel functionality also works on mobile devices
   - Made sure the images display properly on different screen sizes

## Testing Your Portfolio:

1. Run your portfolio locally with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Check that the MikroTik Manager project appears at the top of your projects section

3. Verify that you can navigate between the main interface and login screen images using the carousel arrows

4. Test on both desktop and mobile views to ensure everything looks good at different screen sizes

## Notes:

- The carousel navigation arrows will only appear when hovering over the image in desktop view
- On mobile, the carousel supports touch gestures for swiping between images
- If you add more images in the future, just add their paths to the `images` array in the project data

## Next Steps:

After confirming everything looks good locally, deploy your updated portfolio to make these changes live.
